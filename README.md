# arkit_exploration
Final project for iOS with arkit

Utilized Singleton pattern and Apple's ARKit for Augmented Reality.

User can create line shapes in the 'draw' tab and once happy, press 'save for AR'. In the AR tab the user can then place a canvas containing their art in real space.

It was my first time using ARKit, so ramping up that tech was interesting. I wish I had included some sort of saveable user defaults, adding a photo as a drawing background, and more drawing options. Being able to rotate the canvas would also have been a useful feature. The overall UI is extremely simplistic.
